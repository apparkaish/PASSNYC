# PASSNYC


Non profit organisation providing outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools.

Proxies that have been good indicators of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.

The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.





## Questions to answer:

* We need to analyse the needs of students.

* We need to find the schools to identify which first of all provide these services.

* We need to cross analyze these needs and then map them appropriately.

* Presentation need to be in the form of marketable model.

* PASSNYC provide test preparation, tutoring, mentoring, extracurricular programs, educational consultants, community and student groups, trade associations, and more.
